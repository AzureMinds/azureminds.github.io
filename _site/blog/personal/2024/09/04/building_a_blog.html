<p>So, after much procrastination, I have finally put together a personal website (of sorts) to keep better track of blog posts, personal projects and general ramblings. In the interest of clarity and for those of you interested, here is how I put this together and an explanation of what are the key components. Note: If you are reading this on Medium then the links for my website and associated Github page are https://azureminds.github.io/ and https://github.com/AzureMinds/azureminds.github.io .</p>

<p>Firstly, you may have noticed this site is hosted using Github pages. Github pages offers a way to host a static website (like yours truly) without paying/setting up hosting. On top of this, given my lack of web development expertise and impatience on getting something together, I have built this website using Jekyll. Jekyll is a Ruby package that transforms plain text files and written in markdown or other markup languages like HTML and processes it to create a static website. On top of this, there are a lot of pre-made templates and layout designs and a simple directory structure to build your content. In short, it’s perfect for people who don’t want to reinvent the wheel, building a website similar to this. For those of you looking to get started with Jekyll, I would recommend this https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ if you are looking to install and setup Jekyll for the first time.</p>

<p>Ok, so now you understand Jekyll and Github pages, I am going to outline to you how this website is setout (and yes it may change).</p>

<p>The _config.yml file notes the configuration settings and options for my site. If you inspect the file, you will see I’ve included basic plugins, title, personal details, and usernames that could be useful. Currently, I feel there is a lack of plugins, themes and other configurations but I will develop these over time.</p>

<p>The index.md file typically serves as the main homepage of a jekyll site. When it comes to styling markdown files, I could bore you to death with the optimum approach to this but instead if interested then this link https://docs.gruntwork.io/guides/style/markdown-style-guide/ should help.</p>

<p>In Jekyll, layouts are fundamental to structuring your website. They are stored in the _layouts directory and are written in HTML with embedded Liquid templating tags. The default.html layout typically contains the overall HTML skeleton of your site, including the &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, and common elements like the header and footer. Within layouts,  is used as a placeholder where the content from your Markdown files will be inserted. By using layouts, you can maintain a consistent look and feel across all your pages and posts, making it easier to manage and update your site’s design.</p>

<p>Finally, CSS is used to</p>
