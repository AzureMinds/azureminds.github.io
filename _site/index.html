                <p><p>So, after much procrastination, I have finally put together a personal website (of sorts) to keep better track of blog posts, personal projects and general ramblings.

Note: If you are reading this on Medium then the links for my website and associated Github page are https://azureminds.github.io/ and https://github.com/AzureMinds/azureminds.github.io .</p>
