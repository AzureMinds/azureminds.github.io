Welcome to my blog on all things Data Science and Engineering. Here you will find musings (hopefully with some slight humour) and projects (both completed and upcoming).

Currently I work as a Data Scientist at Fable Data, a company providing anonymised pan European data to Hedge Funds, Corporates and Public Sector Organisations. While I do spend most of my time in tabular data land, my interests extend to NLP, data engineering and different ways of storing said data.
