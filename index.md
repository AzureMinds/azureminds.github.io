Hello! I'm Patrick Stewart, a data science and machine learning enthusiast. I love exploring the intersections of data science, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Currently I work as a Data Scientist at Fable Data, a company providing anonymised pan European data to Hedge Funds, Corporates and Public Sector Organisations.
